# Auth0 / Lock example

This example shows how to get started with the ShareActor SDK and the Auth0's Lock library.

# Prerequisite

- You need to get both a ShareActor `API Key` and an Auth0 `ClientID` matched with your account's `domain`
- You will need to rename the `config.example.js` to `config.js` and to set-up your own keys inside.
- This example needs a product named `test` to be created in your ShareActor dashboard.
