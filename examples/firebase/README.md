# Auth0 / Lock example

This example shows how to get started with the Builton SDK and the Auth0's Lock library.

# Prerequisite

- You need to get both a Builton `API Key` and a Firebase `apiKey` matched with your account's `authDomain`
- You will need to rename the `config.example.js` to `config.js` and to set-up your own keys inside.
